      <p id="mainContent">
        In this project during my internship at the Punta Cana
        International Airport, I designed a simple piece that would go on to save
        the technicians at the maintaince department plenty of valuable time. The
        problem with the ticket machines was that when it started to rain, the ticket machines
        would take in a lot of water through the ticket insertion slot and cause failures, which
        required a maintinance technician to fix. My simple and elegant solution solved the problem
        by placing a small hood over the slot machine which was attached using epoxy ensuring that
        gap between the slot and the hood was water proof. Before the end of my internship, I was
        able to take my project up to the director of land side operations at the airport, and
        implement my part on to every parking ticket machine in the airport.

          In this research project, I looked at the impact that introducing
          ultimate frisbee into empoverished communities could have on
          individuals and the community as a whole. Along with the short video
          shown above, I wrote a research paper to go along with it (the link
          to the paper can be found below). To my surprise, the video reached
          a much larger audience than the one I initially expected. This was
          due to the fact that the video was reposted by the World Flying
          Disc Federation (WFDF), the international governing body of
          ultimate frisbee, on their Facebook page.
